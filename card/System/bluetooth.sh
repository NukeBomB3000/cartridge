# Bluetooth. BaseOS boots with the radio blocked and nothing driving it: up unblocks it, loads
# the Realtek chip's firmware over its UART with rtk_hciattach, and starts bluetoothd; down
# undoes all of it. Pairings are bluetoothd's own, kept in /data/bluetooth. status prints the
# devices the radio knows one to a line, a tab between each field, for cartridge to read:
#
#   device=<MAC>	<audio|gamepad|keyboard|other>	<paired>	<trusted>	<connected>	<name>
#
# paired, trusted and connected are yes or no. The name is the one the device gave, else the alias
# it was given, unless that is only its address, as bluetoothd aliases a device that gave no
# name: a device only found with neither is left out, as most are beacons nobody can pair with.
# One paired is always listed, by its alias whatever that is.
#
# Exit codes: 0 done, 1 Bluetooth is not up (or would not come up), 2 a verb or address this
# script does not take, 3 the pairing failed, 4 paired but the connection failed.
