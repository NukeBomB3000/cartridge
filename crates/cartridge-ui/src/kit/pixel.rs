//! What the kit draws with, as assets/ui/foundation/pixel.js: sprites written as rows of colour
//! keys, one character to an art pixel, the mirrors that make a whole sprite from a quarter, the
//! 9-slices that stretch one to any size, and Pixel Code's letters as sprite rows.
//!
//! The kit's faces are baked at art resolution, one texel to an art pixel. They are uploaded with
//! nearest filtering (`Compositor::create_texture_nearest`) and drawn at exactly `SPRITE_PX` (2x)
//! on even screen offsets, as [`quad`] does, so every edge lands on a whole art pixel.
