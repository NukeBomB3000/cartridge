//! The bottom bar's actions, as assets/ui/components/action-left.js and action-right.js: the
//! game's STATUS / L1 BUTTON on the left and R1 BUTTON / ELF LIST on the right. Left to right,
//! the left one is the arrow in its notch at the screen's edge, a big word, and a button pill
//! with a hint; the right one is the same mirrored, parts and all.
//!
//! It is `BAR` art pixels tall and as wide as its text, with room kept when there is none. The
//! notch rises `RISE` pixels above it, over whatever is there, as the game's does over the
//! backdrop, so the face is `BAR + RISE` tall and clear above the bar beside the notch. A bar's
//! two actions are made together ([`action_pair`]) so they come out the same width, each word
//! and each hint centred in the room of the wider one.
