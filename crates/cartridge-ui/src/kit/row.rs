//! One setting inside a panel's well, as assets/ui/components/cartridge-row.js: its name on the
//! left and its value on the right. The row the cursor is on is lit the way a panel's title tab
//! is drawn: a band in the tab colour with a frame line round it and its corner pixels left out,
//! the words in it light.
//!
//! A row is `ROW_H` art pixels tall, as tall as a panel's header, and as wide as a panel's well
//! and a pixel more each side, the way cartridge-panel lays its rows out: [`row_rect`] says where
//! row `i` of a panel goes. Both words are Pixel Code one face pixel to an art pixel, on a line
//! of 10 with their capitals on rows 3 to 9 of the row, three rows clear above and below.
//!
//! Moving the cursor re-bakes two rows, the one it leaves and the one it lands on; a row's
//! carets keep their room unlit, so its value never moves as the cursor passes.
