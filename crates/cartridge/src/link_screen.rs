//! The link screen a game opens with SELECT + MENU: Host or Join, over a cable or the wireless
//! adapter, then linking, linked, failed or unplugged. It is drawn in the kit over the theme's
//! backdrop, as the menus are: a lone panel titled LINK holding the ROLE and MODE rows and, under
//! them, what is happening; the link's art between it and the bottom bar; and the kit's bar,
//! B RETURN and A LINK while picking, with SELECT MODE and ◀▶ SWAP between them.
//!
//! The art is assets/ui/components/cartridge-link.js's (cartridge_ui::link_art): the link port along the
//! console's top edge, the plug on its cable or the wireless adapter over it, the radio arcs and
//! the clicks of a plug going home. Everything is placed in art pixels and drawn at 2x, so every
//! edge lands on the grid: the plug drops into the port and lifts out of it a whole art pixel at
//! a time, a failed link shakes it a pixel either way, and the arcs pulse in the four steps of
//! kit::fade.
