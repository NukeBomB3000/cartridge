//! The top bar's faces: what the handheld is connected to, on and off, the clock, the battery's
//! figure and its bolt, all baked in the top bar's ink (`ChromeColours::ink`). The ink is the
//! palette's, so a new colour in Settings > Theme bakes them all again, as it does the
//! kit's faces; a card's theme.txt keeps them white. The clock and the figure are also printed
//! again when what they say changes. Every one is the kit's, a texel to an art pixel, uploaded
//! NEAREST.
