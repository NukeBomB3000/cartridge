//! Holding POWER, on any screen: the POWER menu, RESTART and POWER OFF, and after its choice the
//! screen shown until the handheld goes down, as flow.html's `#screen=power`, `#screen=restarting`
//! and `#screen=poweroff`. Both are lone panels over the backdrop, baked once for what they show
//! and the palette.
//!
//! They are put over the screen POWER was held on rather than taking its place, so whatever is
//! under them carries on as it was (a game held still) and B goes back to exactly where it was.
//! The menu opens deeper from that screen, sliding down rather than across: it comes down from
//! the top as the screen drops out of the bottom, the shelf as one, and B is the mirror, the
//! menu going back up as the screen rises into place. A game's picture cannot slide, so it gives
//! way to the backdrop at once and comes back once the menu has gone: the menus are drawn over
//! the backdrop, and the power menu is one of them. Its bar is every menu's, B RETURN and A
//! CONFIRM.
//!
//! A choice slides on deeper to the screen after it, titled RESTART or POWER OFF, which says what
//! is happening, coming down from the top as the menu drops away. Nothing can be pressed there,
//! so it has no actions: the whole bar sinks away as it slides in, as it does when a cart goes
//! in. A power off cartridge decides on its own, for a flat battery or a long doze, slides the
//! same screen in over whatever is shown. It stays until the machine goes down: the last frame
//! drawn before the platform restarts or powers off is left on the panel while it does.
