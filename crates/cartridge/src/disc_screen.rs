//! The DISC screen a PlayStation game on several discs opens with SELECT + MENU, where the link
//! screen opens on a GBA or a Game Boy: the player picks one of the game's discs with Left and
//! Right and A swaps it into the drive, as the console's lid opened and closed would. B, SELECT
//! or SELECT + MENU again close it and leave the disc in. A game on one disc has nothing to
//! swap, and SELECT + MENU says so with a toast.
//!
//! It is drawn in the kit over the theme's backdrop, as the link screen is: a lone panel titled
//! DISC at the top, its DISC row lit with its carets (the disc picked, of how many) and IN DRIVE
//! under it, and the game's title as a note; the game's discs side by side between the panel
//! and the bar, the picked one raised and the others faded back; and the kit's bar, B RETURN and
//! A SWAP with ◀▶ PICK between them. The game is paused under it.
//!
//! Each disc is drawn as the shelf draws it, in three dimensions, out of its stack; a game whose
//! stack is not ready yet shows the face the shelf has for it, flat.
