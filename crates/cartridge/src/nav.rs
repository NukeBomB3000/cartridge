//! Moving between screens. Every move slides: going deeper, the screen left behind leaves to
//! the right as the one it opens comes in from the left; going back, the screen leaves to the
//! left as the one it came from comes back from the right. Settings stands beside the shelf
//! rather than under it, and slides the mirror way: the shelf leaves to the left as Settings
//! comes in from the right, and going back Settings leaves to the right as the shelf comes back
//! from the left. Only those two slides go the mirror way: the screens under Settings, and the
//! Controls panel under the shelf, go deeper and back. The backdrop under them never moves.
//!
//! The shelf slides in two layers rather than as one: its carts leave across, the way the
//! slide goes, and its top bar up off the screen, and they come back the same ways.
//!
//! The power screens slide down rather than across (`dropping`): the POWER menu comes down from
//! the top as the screen it was held on drops out of the bottom, the shelf as one with all its
//! layers, and going back is the mirror.
